### What is this repository for? ###

Basic, **really basic** Shell implementation by C
This project is purely academic with possible improvements over time.

### How do I get set up? ###

Uses gcc *cmake support might be added later*
Uses [GNU readline library](http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/rlman_toc.html)
if you don't have the gnu library, install it 
For debian/ubuntu and similar use
``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
```
if you're using redhat or similar use ```yum``` and install *libreadline-devel* instead
let the make command do the work.
